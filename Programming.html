      <h2>Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          My Web Development started very young at 14 years old. Later at 16, I
          took a Web Design course at Teays High <br> and got a better habit of using
          responsive design and other concepts that help me create my own websites
          with practically <br> no effort. However I am only good in CSS, HTML, and JS.
          This means I have future plans to go into Bootstrap and React.js!
        </p>
      <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
          While at Teays I saw they had a Programming course which was a great
          oppurtunity for me seing as I wanted to start with a language but <br> didn't
          know where to start at all. I took it and after scratch we started into
          python 2.5! I now know both 2.5 and 3.5+ after learning 3 on my own.
          <br> Visit this page to see some of the things ive created with python.
        </p>
      <h2>C++</h2>
        <p>
          C++ kicked me down so hard i had to crawl to get back up. Most of this
          is my fault however, I skipped looking at the Object Oriented Programming
          thought process like we started with in Python, and even failed to just
          look up a simple video about it.
        </p>
